	content for games, both digital and nondigital (such as board games).
	The term search-based procedural content generation is proposed as
	the name for this emerging field, which at present is growing quickly.
	A taxonomy for procedural content generation is devised, centering
	on what kind of content is generated, how the content is represented
	and how the quality/fitness of the content is evaluated; search-based
	procedural content generation in particular is situated within this
	taxonomy. This article also contains a survey of all published papers
	known to the authors in which game content is generated through search
	or optimisation, and ends with an overview of important open research
	problems.},
